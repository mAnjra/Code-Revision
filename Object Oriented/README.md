Scanner, String, ArrayList are all objects, they share that similarity - yet they are all different classes. 
Objects are instances of classes. A class describes the "blueprint" of the objects that are made out of it (are instances of it).

     " It is clear that all objects are not similar to one another. 
      For example, ArrayList objects differ drastically from String objects. 
      All ArrayLists have the same methods add, contains, remove, size, ... and respectively all String objects have 
      the same methods (substring, length, charAt, ...). Arraylist and String objects do not have the same methods 
      because they are different types of objects.

      The type of a certain group of objects is called a class. 
      ArrayList is a class, as are String, Scanner, and so forth. 
      Objects, on the other hand, are instances of classes.

      Objects of the same class all have the same methods and a similar state. 
      For example, the state of an ArrayList object consists of elements inserted to the list 
      while the state of a String object consists of a string of characters. "
